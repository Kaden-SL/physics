- All Assets were created by me, Kaden Sedmak-Locke, on the online pixelart editor Piskel.com
- Each level uses a variety of inputs from the player, with each focusing on a different type of movement for the player to make it to the goal moving the on screen car sprite.
- There are 3 distinct scenes, and 3 scenes seperating them giving a little recap of a relevant stat and time taken so far.
- All of the code for scenes was sourced from phaser examples and documentation.
- Level 1 is basic platforming movement.
- Level 2 is hovering movement.
- Level 3 a quick little dash boost movement based level.
